## Requirements

### General

- You can choose the language of your choice.
- OS needs to be Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Tasks List

0. `factors` - ***0. Factorize all the things!*** : Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
1. `rsa` - ***1. RSA Factoring Challenge*** : RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n , there exist prime numbers p and q such that
n = p Ã— q . The problem is to find these two primes, given only n .
